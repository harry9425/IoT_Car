# LSCRB 
# Introducing LSCRB (Live Surveillance Car without Range Boundation), an innovative IoT project that combines the latest technology to create a surveillance car that can operate in potentially harmful conditions. This robot car is equipped with an inbuilt camera that is connected to an image processing model that detects any harmful things such as weapons. It is controlled through an android application on a mobile device, and it is connected to the internet using Firebase as the backend, resulting in an infinite communication range.

The car also includes a RFID scanner that scans the mobile device used to control the car, acting as a kind of key to start the car by tapping the mobile's NFC on the RFID reader. The car is controlled using the gyroscope on the mobile device, providing a unique way of controlling the car. The live feed from the camera is being broadcast on the phone app, and you can also send a message to the car display from the phone if you want to convey a message to someone.

LSCRB is designed for use in potentially harmful conditions, making it ideal for surveillance, security, and other applications. The car is built using Arduino, NodeMCU, IoT, camera, OpenCV, android studio, and Firebase. The combination of these technologies allows for a high level of customization and flexibility, making LSCRB a powerful and versatile tool for a wide range of applications.
